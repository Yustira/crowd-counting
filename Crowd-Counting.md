# Crowd Counting: Video Surveillance Upgrade for Monitoring Physical Distancing (BDG2-D)

## What is Crowd Counting? Why do we need that?
Crowd Counting is a technique used to count the number of objects in a picture.
Counting how many objects in an image is essential for various industries and researchs. Some of the use-cases are:

* **Counting Cells/Viruses/Bacteria/Pathogens:** \
  1.Revealing the information about the progress of infectious disease.\
  2.Providing growth and death rate for research.\
  3.Adjusting the amount of chemical substance to be given.
  
* **Community Events Counting:**\
  1.Quantifying the performances or shows based on the number of people.\
  2.Providing data for further analysis.
  
* **Safety and Road:** \
  1.Monitoring high traffic roads, or public places.\
  2.Preventing people for entering the forbidden, or dangerous places.\
  3.Detecting accident or fight when people are suddenly assembling.
  
* **Marketing:**\
  1.Giving the information about the favorite spots where a high number of people gather.\
  2.Analyzing the road which many vehicle pass through for adversitising.
  
There are so many others use-cases of Crowd Counting that is not mentioned in here. This is show the usefullness of crowd counting in real life. Because of that reasons too, we will focus to develop crowd counting technique on this project. However, Crowd Counting is not an easy task instead a laborious task and often occured counting error when dealing with something like these pictures:

Too reduce the wasted time because of counting endlessly every images or forgeting the count after counting to 100, We can use **Convolutional Neural Network** as a crowd counting method. 

Started from somehing simple, The first things we consider to use is a plain CNN with an images as the input and the count as the label. 
Before we move into the model, we'll show the dataset!

## The Dataset, Why do we choose this dataset?

## Baseline Model, How does the result?
