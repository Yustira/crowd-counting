# Crowd Counting: Video Surveillance Upgrade for Monitoring Physical Distancing (BDG2-D)

## What is Crowd Counting? Why do we need that?
Crowd Counting is a technique used to count the number of objects in a picture.
Counting how many objects in an image is essential for various industries and researchers. Some of the use-cases are:

* **Counting Cells/Viruses/Bacteria/Pathogens:** \
  1.Revealing the information about the progress of infectious disease.\
  2.Providing growth and death rate for research.\
  3.Adjusting the amount of chemical substance to be given.
  
* **Community Events Counting:**\
  1.Quantifying the performances or shows based on the number of people.\
  2.Providing data for further analysis.
  
* **Safety and Road:** \
  1.Monitoring high traffic roads, or public places.\
  2.Preventing people from entering the forbidden, or dangerous places.\
  3.Detecting accident or fight when people are suddenly assembling.
  
* **Marketing:**\
  1.Giving information about the favorite spots where a high number of people gather.\
  2.Analyzing the road which many vehicles pass-through for advertising.
  
There are so many others use-cases of Crowd Counting that are not mentioned here. This shows the usefulness of crowd counting in real life. Because of that reason too, we will focus to develop crowd counting techniques on this project. However, crowd Counting is not an easy task instead of a laborious task and often occurred counting error when dealing with something like these pictures:

Too reduce the wasted time because of counting endlessly every image or forgetting the count after counting to 100, We can use **Convolutional Neural Network** as a crowd counting method. 

Started from something simple, The first thing we consider to use is a plain CNN with an image as the input and the count as the label. 
Before we move into the model, we'll show the dataset!

## The Dataset. Why do we choose this dataset?

## Baseline Model. How does the result?

## Improvement. What can be improved?
